Here's my first post on the new Hugo version of the site. It's being typed on a newish keyboard layout. I'm up to about 40 WPM without caps, numbers or symbols. Caps slow me down because I'm using autocaps - <130 ms gets lowercase, >130 ms gets upper case. Unless it's a dual-purpose key, then the window for the caps closes at 300 milliseconds and the key switches to a mod or a layer - alt, control, gui, shift or symbol, navigation, numbers, functions. On my laptop built-in (a Japanese or I couldn't have space, backspace, tab, t and g on my thumbs) only 30 keys are enabled. Thanks to [kmonad][https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad] which I use to do all that on the laptop built-in and [QMK][https://qmk.fm] on my mechanical keyboard.
That was all one long line and this will be 2 short ones to test Hugo.
Or, more accurately the theme.
To get started I just pulled the first theme off a search for Hugo theme gruvbox (my favourite common theme for displays neither eink nor oled).
That actually didn't work. The theme had a bunch of errors relating to things the author had left out, like taxonomy, so now I'm using [https://github.com/cntrump/hugo-notepadium][notepadium].
That's it for testing.
Next up: trying to migrate my old blog posts.
