      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my first post on the new Hugo version of the site. It&amp;rsquo;s being typed on a newish keyboard layout. I&amp;rsquo;m up to about 40 WPM without caps, numbers or symbols. Caps slow me down because I&amp;rsquo;m using autocaps - &amp;lt;130 ms gets lowercase, &amp;gt;130 ms gets upper case. Unless it&amp;rsquo;s a dual-purpose key, then the window for the caps closes at 300 milliseconds and the key switches to a mod or a layer - alt, control, gui, shift or symbol, navigation, numbers, functions. On my laptop built-in (a Japanese or I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have space, backspace, tab, t and g on my thumbs) only 30 keys are enabled. Thanks to [kmonad][https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad] which I use to do all that on the laptop built-in and [QMK][https://qmk.fm] on my mechanical keyboard.
That was all one long line and this will be 2 short ones to test Hugo.
Or, more accurately the theme.
To get started I just pulled the first theme off a search for Hugo theme gruvbox (my favourite common theme for displays neither eink nor oled).
That actually didn&amp;rsquo;t work. The theme had a bunch of errors relating to things the author had left out, like taxonomy, so now I&amp;rsquo;m using [https://github.com/cntrump/hugo-notepadium][notepadium].
That&amp;rsquo;s it for testing.
Next up: trying to migrate my old blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
